The flow is made available to all                                the participants at the same time and can be consumed independently. Since this is the                                competition on data streams, a critical remark for all participants is to strictly                                respect the schedule and the deadlines.                            </p>                        <ul>                            <li class="justified">                                <b> Registration/Subscription: </b> all participants are asked to register to the                                platform by providing an email and a password. Thereafter, users can subscribe to the                                competition and every user is provided a secret key to be used subsequently to secure                                bi-directional stream communication with the platform. Data release starts and ends                                according to the specified schedule of the competition.

Test and learning                                instances are released in batches every time interval. When a test batch is released,                                participants must submit their predictions before the specified due date, otherwise,                                they will be penalized with a worst-case value for used evaluation metric.                            </li>                            <li class="justified">                                <b> Evaluation and Results: </b> submitted predictions are evaluated online and results                                are updated live.
