                        <h4>Description of the Tasks</h4>
                        <li> <p align="justify"> This track in the IEEE Big Data 2019 Big Data Cup represents the first
                            of its kind, Machine Learning competition on data streams. The main idea is to build
                            incremental classifiers and provide the predictions for the data instances that are arriving
                            in stream.
                        </p>
                        </li>

                        <li> <p align="justify">  Data streams, such as data originated from sensors, have increasingly
                            gained the interest of researchers and companies and are currently widely studied in data
                            science. For example, companies in the telecommunication and energy industry are trying to
                            exploit these data and get real-time insights on their services and equipment. To be able
                            to extract valuable knowledge from data streams, one must be able to analyze the data as
                            they arrive and make meaningful predictions. For this purpose, we use fast incremental
                            learners. For batch learners there already exists a community that is organizing various
                            competitions on machine learning tasks to obtain models with better performance. We want to
                            introduce the same approach to engage the whole community in solving essential problems in
                            data stream mining. We propose a new kind of data science competition based on a real-time
                            prediction setting, using our novel platform on data streams. The examples to predict are
                            going to be sent in real-time, and the predictions should also be submitted in real-time.
                            To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first data science competition conducted in
                            real-time. The task of the competition is to predict network activity, and the data will be
                            provided from one of our partner companies.</p>
