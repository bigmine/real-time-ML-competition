                        <h4>Description of the Tasks</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li class="justified"> This track in the IEEE Big Data 2019 Big Data Cup represents Machine
                            Learning competition on data streams the first of its kind. The main idea is to build
                            incremental classifiers and provide the predictions for the data instances that are arriving
                            in stream.
                        </li>
                        <li class="justified">
                                In order to organize this kind of competition there was a need for a dedicated platform
                                with specific infrastructure. Having this in mind, this competition will be conducted on
                                our novel platform built for those purposes. <b> The Platform For Data Science
                                Competitions on Data Streams </b>is able to provide multiple streams to multiple users,
                                to receive multiple streams, process them and provide the leader board and live results.
                                The link to our platform will be provided as soon all the preparations have been finished.
                        </li>
                        <li class="justified"> Data streams, such as data originated from sensors, have increasingly
                            gained the interest of researchers and companies and are currently widely studied in data
                            science. For example, companies in the telecommunication and energy industry are trying to
                            exploit these data and get real-time insights on their services and equipment. To be able
                            to extract valuable knowledge from data streams, one must be able to analyze the data as
                            they arrive and make meaningful predictions. For this purpose, we use fast incremental
                            learners.

                        <li class="justified">
                            For the purpose of this competition we will explain the principles of online, incremental
                            learning. In online learning, data are not available as static dataset, though data arrive
                            in stream of records(instances). We assume that records in the data stream arrive in
                            batches (batch can also have size of one record). We distinguish two types of batches:
                            <ul>
                            <li class="justified"> <b> Initial batch: </b> This batch is used to build and train the initial model. It
                            is used to avoid cold start problem and as such contains both features and
                            targets. Initial batch usually has large number of instances.
                            </li>
                            <li class="justified">  <b> Regular batch: </b> Regular batch contains test and training instances.
                                Training instances contain both features and targets, while test instances contain just
                                features as they are used to evaluate the quality of the model.
                            </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                            <p align="justify">
                            In figure 1 is shown the process of online learning. As mentioned before, we can see the
                            difference between the initial batch and the regular batches. After building the initial
                            model based on initial batch, that model is tested on test instances (which do not contain
                            target value) and in the next batch when training instances are received for previous batch,
                            model is updated.

                                The goal of the competition is to build models able to predict the future values of the
                                series with high accuracy while taking into account the evolutionary nature of these
                                data. These models must be able to learn incrementally and detect changes in order to
                                adapt to them as soon as they occur. When the competition starts, data will be released
                                as a data stream. Their models will be evaluated using the evaluation metric, that will
                                be specified in the detailed competition description.
